# Movie Ticket Reservation System
ENSF 480: Principles of Software Design Final Project 
In this project our team was tasked to analyze, design, and develop a system that can be used by two
group of users: ordinary users that can search for a movie, select a specific theater, view
available movies and showtimes, view graphically available seats for a selected movie, select the
desired seat, make payment by credit card, receive a copy of ticket and the receipt, via email.
Users also should be able to cancel their ticket only up to 72 hours prior to show and receive a
credit with %15 administration fee for future purchase up maximum of one-year expiration date.
The other group of users are those who must be registered (let’s call them Registered Users,
RUs), and their information such as name, address, credit and/or debit card account must be
saved on the system’s database. RUs must pay a $20.00 annual account fee, but they don't have
to pay 15% admin fee for cancelling their tickets and will receive the movie news before public
announcement. There is also one more constraint: Only 10% of the seats can be purchased by
RUs on a first come first serve policy prior to public announcements.
